# Smart Email Frontend üñåÔ∏è

This is the React-based frontend for the Smart Email application. It provides a clean and simple user interface for interacting with the AI-powered backend to generate email content effortlessly.

## Features
-   **Interactive UI:** A simple text area for users to input their email generation prompts.
-   **Real-time Responses:** Communicates with the backend API to fetch and display the AI-generated email in real-time.
-   **Responsive Design:** A clean layout that works on different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack
-   **React**
-   **JavaScript**
-   **CSS** (or specify your styling library, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI)
-   **Axios** (for making API requests to the backend)

## Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v16 or later)
-   npm or yarn

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ArmanShaikh684/Smart-Email-Frontend.git](https://github.com/ArmanShaikh684/Smart-Email-Frontend.git)
    cd Smart-Email-Frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(or `yarn install` if you use Yarn)*

3.  **Configuration:**
    The application needs to know the URL of the backend API. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variable:
    
    **.env.local**
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```
    *Note: Your code will need to use `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` to access this value.*

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *(or `yarn start`)*

    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use
1.  Make sure the backend server is running.
2.  Open the application in your browser.
3.  Type a prompt into the text box describing the email you want to write.
4.  Click the "Generate" button.
5.  The AI-generated email will appear in the response area below.
